# TDDBilling
TDD exercise using a simple billing system feature set.

Using red/green/refactor cycle:

1. First write a failing test,

2. Then write the minimal feature code to pass the test, 

3. Finally refactor and clean up the codebase.

Repeat this till all the features are complete and tested working.
